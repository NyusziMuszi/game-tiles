# NYT Tiles game

////Hi FAC...Super sad, but this is not quite resolved. I will work a bit more on it tomorrow, which will fall beyond the deadline. Hope you will none the less evaulate it. Thank you!

I enjoy the NYT Tiles game: https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/tiles. This is a modified version of that, featuring a timer and increasing difficulty levels. It is built with vanillia JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

This game is based on Ania Kubow's memory game code. Thank you!
