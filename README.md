# NYT Tiles game

////Hi FAC...I apologise, getting the game to work turned out to be more challanging than I anticipated. As you can see some of this was done after the deadline. Hope you will none the less evaulate it. Thank you!

I enjoy the NYT Tiles game, Tiles: https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/tiles. This is a modified version of it, featuring a timer and increasing difficulty levels, with 2 decks available currently. It is built with vanillia JavaScript, HTML and CSS, 100% tutorial and ChatGPT free.
